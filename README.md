# Bucket Fill Algorithm Implementation

## Project Description
This project is an implementation of the bucket fill algorithm, commonly used in image editing software. The algorithm is designed to fill a contiguous area in a 2D image with a new color or pattern. The implementation includes functionalities for loading images from files, represented as grids of pixels, and efficiently filling areas starting from a specified point.

## Contents:
- `bucket_fill.py` : Core implementation of the bucket fill algorithm and image loading function.
- `test_bucket_fill.py` : Test suite for verifying the correctness and robustness of the bucket fill algorithm.
